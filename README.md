# Basic Perceptron and other Algorithms 

Codes for Perceptron, Voted Perceptron, Fisher's LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), Least Squares using Matrix Inversion, LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) using Tf-Idf with Cosine Similarity & Multiclass Perceptrons (also implemented k-fold cross validation)

## File Structure

** VotedAndVanillaPerceptron.py

Contains the code for Voted and Vanilla Perceptron

** VotedAndVanillaPerceptronCV.py

Contains the code for Voted and Vanilla Perceptron, with Accuracy testing and k-fold Cross Validations (implemented from scratch)

** FisherLeastSquare1.py and FisherLeastSquare2.py

Contains the code for LDA, Least Squares (using Matrix Inversion and Widrow Hoff), Perceptron and comparision of those 3 for 2 different datasets.

** LSAUsingTFIDFandPerceptron.py

Contains the code to create BagOfWords and Tf-Idf matrix from a list of documents (belonging to a certain class) and then classify new documents using both Cosine Similarity and Multiclass Perceptron.
